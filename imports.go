// This file exists as a dependency for users of gosim. The CLI, through
// internal/translate, needs to be able to import all packages below when run
// _inside_ the user's module. By importing the gosim package their go.mod will
// get all the required dependencies.

// TODO: allow fixing these at a different, independent version? what if there
// are multiple go.mod because we run on multiple versions?
